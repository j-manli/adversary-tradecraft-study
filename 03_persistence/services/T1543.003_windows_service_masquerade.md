# T1543.003 â€“ Windows Service Masquerade

**MITRE ATT&CK Reference:** [T1543.003 â€“ Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/)

> Some attackers donâ€™t kick in the door â€” they walk in dressed like IT.

This scenario picks up where our [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://github.com/j-manli/adversary-tradecraft-study/blob/main/07_command_and_control/ingress_tool_transfer/T1105_bitsadmin_payload_staging.md) left off. After staging a payload using `bitsadmin`, the attacker establishes persistence by creating a masqueraded Windows service pointing to a Sliver C2 binary.

The service is registered as **Windows Update Service**, and the payload lives at `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\updater.exe`.  
It's close enough to feel familiar, but just off enough to matter.

## Host Configuration

- **Attacker VM:** `HR-COMPLAINTS` (Sliver C2 on Ubuntu 22.04)  
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.51`
- **Target VM:** `CEO-LAPTOP` (Windows 10 with MDE onboarded)  
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.69`  
  - **Admin Username:** `TrustMeBro`

---

## Execution

On the target machine, the attacker (logged in as the admin, `TrustMeBro`) registers a new Windows service using `sc.exe`. The service is given a believable name and description to avoid suspicion during casual review:

```cmd
sc.exe create "Windows Update Service" binPath= "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\updater.exe" start= auto DisplayName= "Windows Update Service"
sc.exe description "Windows Update Service" "Provides updates for your system."
```

This command sets the stage for persistence. By using the `start= auto` parameter, the service is configured to launch automatically on system boot, running as **SYSTEM** by default. A manual trigger was issued shortly after to test execution:

```cmd
sc.exe start "Windows Update Service"
```

From the attacker's perspective, the callback was immediate. Within the Sliver C2 interface, a session appeared â€” verifying that `updater.exe` executed successfully as a SYSTEM-level process.

## Detection and Hunting

In Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, the attack chain leaves behind multiple high-signal artifacts â€” even without prior intel.

### Timeline Observations

- At **8:59 PM**, `powershell.exe` spawned `sc.exe` with a command line that created the **Windows Update Service**.
- Immediately afterward, `services.exe` created the registry key `SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\Windows Update Service`, confirming service registration.
- At **9:39 PM**, another `powershell.exe` process launched `sc.exe` again â€” this time to start the service.
- Seconds later, `services.exe` spawned `updater.exe`.
- MDE flagged the activity as **Trojan:Win32/SuspGolang.AG**, catching the behavior despite the file being staged stealthily.

### ðŸ§  Hunting with KQL

#### New Services (last 24h)
```kql
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType == "ServiceInstalled"
| where Timestamp > ago(24h)
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, FolderPath
| sort by Timestamp desc
```

This query flagged the suspicious install path:
```
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\updater.exe
```

#### Services Installed Outside System32
```kql
DeviceEvents
| where ActionType == "ServiceInstalled"
| where FolderPath !startswith "C:\\Windows\\System32"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

This callout helps identify binaries living in obscure places.

#### Service Execution Chain
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName == "services.exe"
| where FileName == "updater.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, FolderPath
```

This tied the `services.exe` execution directly to the callback binary, `updater.exe`.

## Network Visibility

To understand the binary's behavior beyond process execution, we pivoted to network telemetry.

Using this KQL query, we scoped outbound activity from `updater.exe` on the target host:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "ceo-laptop"
| where InitiatingProcessFileName == "updater.exe"
| project Timestamp, RemoteUrl, RemoteIP, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, ReportId
```

This revealed outbound connections to the Sliver C2 listener hosted on `10.1.0.51`. Even without a domain or suspicious string in the command line, the binary established direct communication with a remote host.

Combined with process tree (`services.exe` â†’ `updater.exe`) and non-standard binary path, this connection solidified the malicious chain.

## Remediation and Recommendations

This activity chain shows how easily a system-level backdoor can blend in with built-in tooling and believable naming.

### Detection Recommendations

- **Alert on new services** where:
  - The binary path is outside trusted locations (e.g., not under `C:\Windows\System32`)
  - The initiating process is `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, or a user context
- **Hunt for service names** that impersonate legitimate Windows services (`Windows Update`, `Security Center`, etc.)
- **Monitor for outbound connections** from rarely seen or suspiciously named binaries like `updater.exe`.

### Remediation Actions

- Quarantine or delete the malicious binary (`updater.exe`)
- Remove the service:
  ```cmd
  sc.exe delete "Windows Update Service"
  ```
- Scope the environment for similar naming schemes and download paths
- Investigate for lateral movement or credential theft post-compromise
- Review audit logs for persistence attempts via other T1543.003 attempts
