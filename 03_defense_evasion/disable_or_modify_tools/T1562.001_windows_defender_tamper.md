# T1562.001 – Disable or Modify Windows Defender

**MITRE ATT&CK Reference:** [T1562.001 – Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/)

Before attackers dump credentials or move laterally, they often clear the way by turning off the alarms.

In this scenario, an attacker with local admin access disables Microsoft Defender using real-world techniques documented in real-world incidents. 
These commands are often seen early in ransomware campaigns and targeted hands-on-keyboard intrusions.

The goal: quietly reduce detection before executing higher-risk actions like reconnaissance or memory dumping.

## Host Configuration

- **Target VM:** `CEO-LAPTOP` (Windows 10 with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint)
  - **IP:** `10.1.0.69`
  - **Admin Username:** `TrustMeBro`

---

## Execution

The attacker, logged in locally as an administrator (`TrustMeBro`), executed a series of PowerShell commands to weaken the host’s defenses prior to credential access or lateral movement.

### 1. Disable Real-Time Protection
```powershell
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
```
This command turned off Defender’s real-time monitoring, reducing the chance of payload interception or memory scan alerts.

### 2. Add Folder Exclusion
```powershell
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows"
```
By excluding the ProgramData path, future binaries dropped there (like payloads or tools) would bypass Defender scanning.

### 3. Attempt to Stop Defender Service
```powershell
sc.exe stop WinDefend
```
Even with tamper protection disabled, this command failed with an `Access Denied` error, signaling that service-level protections remained enforced by the OS or endpoint policy.

## Detection and Hunting

Microsoft Defender flagged the tampering behavior in the Device Timeline but did not generate an alert. 
To investigate further, we started with standard process-based queries, then pivoted to the registry for confirmation.

### Device Timeline Observations

Two key events appeared in the Device Timeline during testing:

- `powershell.exe` executed a command to **disable real-time protection** using `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true`
- Shortly after, another PowerShell command to add a Defender exclusion triggered an **AMSI-based detection** for suspicious content.
  
Both actions did occurr, even though they were not surfaced in standard process or alert telemetry.

### Attempted Process-Based Detection (No Results)

We first attempted to identify the tampering commands using the following process-level query:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_any ("Set-MpPreference", "DisableRealtimeMonitoring", "Add-MpPreference", "ExclusionPath")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```

> **Result:** No matching events were returned, despite the behavior being visible in the Device Timeline.
> This suggests telemetry delay or a visibility limitation for certain PowerShell-based AMSI detections.

---

### Registry-Based Detection (Confirmed)

Pivoting to registry events, we found high-confidence evidence of Defender tampering:

```kql
DeviceRegistryEvents
| where RegistryKey has "Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Exclusions"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, RegistryKey, RegistryValueName, ActionType, InitiatingProcessFileName
```

This revealed a registry change adding an suspicious exclusion for `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows`, along with the initiating process and timestamp.

## Remediation and Recommendations

Tampering with Defender often precedes credential theft or malware staging. While some detections flagged the activity quietly, the lack of alerts shows how this technique can slip past default protections.

### Detection Recommendations

- Enable **PowerShell Script Block Logging** to increase visibility into command usage.
- Hunt for use of `Set-MpPreference` and `Add-MpPreference` in both process and registry contexts.
- Monitor for changes to Defender exclusion paths, especially involving non-standard or user-controlled locations.

### Remediation Actions

- Review and remove suspicious Defender exclusions.
- Investigate the initiating user for signs of credential dumping or further malicious activity.
- Re-enable Defender protections and validate the host’s security state:
  ```powershell
  Get-MpComputerStatus
  ```
