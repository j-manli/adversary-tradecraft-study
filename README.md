# Adversary Tradecraft Study

This project simulates real-world attacker techniques mapped to MITRE ATT&CK and evaluates how well they are detected and understood from a defender’s perspective.

Each scenario focuses on tradecraft relevant to modern SOC and MDR operations, including:

- Initial access, evasion, and persistence
- Credential attacks and lateral movement
- Active Directory abuse and coercion techniques
- Detection visibility via an EDR solution (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, in this case)

> Built as part of my ongoing study into adversary TTPs, how they appear (or don’t) in telemetry, and what can be done to detect or mitigate them.
