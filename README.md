# Adversary Tradecraft Study

This project simulates real-world adversary behaviors across the attack lifecycle to better understand how threats manifest from both an offensive and defensive perspective. Each scenario is aligned with MITRE ATT&CK techniques and demonstrates practical applications of attacker tradecraft using native system tools and open-source resources.

While the primary focus is on simulating attacker activity, the project also explores detection visibility and investigation opportunities through endpoint telemetry, log artifacts, and system impact analysis.

The structure follows a progressive flow from attacker mindset to post-compromise activity and is designed to reinforce foundational knowledge and surface realistic gaps a defender may encounter.

> TLDR; A hands-on exploration of real-world attacker techniques, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, with a focus on visibility, impact, and SOC relevance.
